# bBot Modules

## <img src="img/map.svg" height="30"> Roadmap

bBot is in active development with an [alpha][alpha] version focused on
fundamentals for ease of maintenance and fully tested module design.

The upcoming [beta][beta] will include modules that work together to provide
bBot's unique features for modelling and executing conversational UI.

The first [release][release] will add tutorials and examples to get started.
With at least one of each adapter to provide full utility and patterns.s

Subsequent minor versions [post release][post-release] will add adapters for a
variety of storage, natural language, and messaging platforms (including for
voice interfaces).

Our next **major version** will add a UI for conversation designers to prototype
and test interactions, while maintaining the flexibility for coders.

## **Alpha** | June 2018

### <img src="img/code.svg" height="20"> Application

- Released under the [MIT Licence][mit]
- Built in [Typescript][typescript] for [Node.js](node)
- Code follows [StandardJS][standard] style
- Compiles to [ES2015 Javascript][es6]
- Documentation generated by [TypeDoc](typedoc)
- Logging is handled by [Winston][winston]
- Configuration is handled by [Yargs][yargs]
- Unit testing with [Mocha][mocha], [Chai][chai], [SinonJs][sinon]
- Test Coverage with [Istanbul][istanbul]

### <img src="img/code.svg" height="20"> Message Adapters

Use any messaging platform to hear and respond to message. In alpha, we include
adapters for [Rocket.Chat][rc] and a command line adapter for testing.

### <img src="img/db.svg" height="20"> Storage Adapters

Use any storage provider to save the bot's memory and persist transactional data
like messages. We include [Mongo][mongo] and [Redis][redis] by default.

### <img src="img/bit.svg" height="20"> Bit

Bits provide a simple schema for defining a single point within a series of
interactions. Bits link together to make conversations.

### <img src="img/brain.svg" height="20"> Brain

Controls all the operational memory and handles anything stored longer
term. It keeps known users and messaging history or custom data sets.

### <img src="img/config.svg" height="20"> Config

Apply settings from command line arguments, environment variables or config
files. Accessible to all modules and extensions.

### <img src="img/play.svg" height="20"> Core

Control and access the running status - pause, play, shutdown, reboot.
**~(O_O)~** bleep bloop.

### <img src="img/id.svg" height="20"> ID

Assigns every listener, message, user and state instance within either a hash 
or sequential id, tracing every event to it's source.

### <img src="img/listen.svg" height="20"> Listen

Match incoming messages to callbacks by text pattern, natural language
processing, or custom functions and fallbacks.

### <img src="img/message.svg" height="20"> Message

Received from the platform, with user and room meta. Response envelopes can
address user, room or a platform event, like reactions and topic changes.

### <img src="img/state.svg" height="20"> State

Provided to callbacks, contains all attributes of the bot and current
interaction (message matching and language processing). Used to invoke response.

### <img src="img/webhook.svg" height="20"> Webhooks

An internal express server sets up HTTP listeners, to change the bot's state
or trigger interactions in the message platform.

### <img src="img/server.svg" height="20"> HTTP Requests

Post or get content between the bot and external services to provide real-time
context to an interaction.

---

## **Beta** | July 2018

### <img src="img/nlp.svg" height="20"> Natural Language Adapters

We will include [Watson][watson] as a default option for adding NLU to match
and respond based on message intent, entities and/or sentiment.

### <img src="img/path.svg" height="20"> Path

An essential component for conversations. Matches message against possible
branches in a tightly scoped context. Adapts to user input in real-time.

### <img src="img/dialogue.svg" height="20"> Dialogue

Controls conversation paths, with fallbacks and timeouts. Routes responses as required.

### <img src="img/scene.svg" height="20"> Scene

Enters and conducts audience participation in dialogue. Audience can be a user
or a whole room. Once engaged, the bot processes input within that context.

### <img src="img/improv.svg" height="20"> Improv

Parses message templates at runtime with data from user attributes,
collected context and/or custom extensions.

### <img src="img/director.svg" height="20"> Director

Provides conversation firewalls, allowing certain users to be authorised or
blocked from entering particular interactions.

### <img src="img/outline.svg" height="20"> Outline

A simple conversation modelling schema. It's attributes automatically configure
modules to populate and conduct a series of interactions.

### <img src="img/transcript.svg" height="20"> Transcript

Record conversation event details. Transcripts are searchable and can be used to
populate response context from interaction history.

## **Release** | August 2018

### <img src="img/chat.svg" height="20"> Message Adapters

Messaging platform support extends to [Slack][slack] and [Messenger][messenger].

### <img src="img/payload.svg" height="20"> Rich Messages

Send messages with rich UI payloads. Attach button menus and multimedia content,
to be presented in the message platform.

### <img src="img/laptop.svg" height="20"> Feature Tutorials

The bot comes loaded with a variety of example interactions that can be engaged
with and modified to learn the basics.

## Post Release | Q4 2018

### <img src="img/i18n.svg" height="20"> Internationalisation

Providing multi-lingual scripts allows the i18n module to change the bot's
language in real-time, based on user attributes or NLU detection.

### <img src="img/dashboard.svg" height="20"> Web Dashboard

View the operational status and active behaviour of the bot. Can report on known
users and interaction transcripts.

### <img src="img/analytics.svg" height="20"> Analytics Adapters

Provide a drill down feed of analytics data to external platforms. We'll package
[Chatbase][chatbase] as a default provider.

### <img src="img/webhook.svg" height="20"> Webhook Adapters

Integrate events and share data with external platforms without effort. We'll
provide [Zapier][zapier] to start.

### <img src="img/chat.svg" height="20"> Message Adapters

Messaging platform support extends to [Telegram][telegram], [Discord][discord],
[Hangouts][hangouts] as well as voice platforms (TBA).

### <img src="img/nlp.svg" height="20"> Natural Language Adapters

We'll add more adapters for [Rasa][rasa], [Wit.ai][wit] and
[Dialogflow][dialogflow].
